# ai-lab
A fun little project where I try to build various AI models from scratch. The goal is to avoid frameworks like Tensorflow/Pytorch in favor of implementing things myself with libraries like numpy. Eventually I might switch over to using PyTorch in this repo, but until I'm working on much more complicated projects I likely won't.

## NAND
First project. An implementation of a model trained to perform the NAND operation using a perceptron based neural network (composed of one neuron :O).
